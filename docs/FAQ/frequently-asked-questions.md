### What is lavalink?

Lavalink is a standalone program, written in Java. Lavalink allows for sending audio without it ever reaching any of your shards. It is a great alternative to youtube-dl. Unlike raw voice solutions, such as VoiceNext, Lavalink can handle hundreds of concurrent streams, and supports sharding.

### What do I put in ID / Identifier

Put it as anything, it doesn't matter as long as it's one sentence and there's no `'`

### What if one or more of these servers are down?

Well you can simply contact the owner of it, or if the server has been down for 7 days you can make a Pull Request removing the server completely

Tho, if you want to use the SSL lavalink you need to make sure your bot uses that protocol.
