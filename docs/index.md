### F.A.S.Q. (Frequently Asked Stupid Questions)

Is there a difference between SSL and Without SSL?
> No there isn't. one uses a certificate and one doesn't. For website it is crucial to have an SSL cert for credibility, but for lavalink no. it is unnecessary. plus You don't wanna be the next [manjaro](https://manjarno.snorlax.sh/) right? :3

Is it true that SSL are more secure?
> No.

Is lavalink with SSL faster?
> Depends, most lavalink that has SSL usually are hosted on replit *and others* free hosting provider, interms of reliability they're most likely to restart every few days or so.

If I wanted to host lavalink and make it public, should I use cloudflare?
> tbh, no. Cloudflare [drops websocket connection randomly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39668410/whats-disconnecting-my-websocket-connection-cloudflare-apaches-mod-proxy), thus if you want your public lavalink to be reliable you shouldn't use cloudflare. If you're worried about ddos, consider getting server host that has ddos protection. such as [hetzner](https://hetzner.com) or [ovh](https://ovh.com)
